# installing the local package editably via pip
# works, but none of the dependencies (e.g. ml4gw)
# are installed editably, so we'll opt for using
# the full poetry machinery without using a
# virtual environment. Note that this can potentially
# cause issues if the poetry install makes changes to
# the virtualenv package in the base environment, so
# we'll hard pin it to the value we need.
# TODO: there's got to be a better solution here
