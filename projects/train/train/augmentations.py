    """
    Module that takes a sample of data, splits it into
    two unequal-length segments, calculates the PSD of
    the first section, then returns this PSD along with
    the second section.

    Args:
        length:
            The length, in seconds, of timeseries data
            to be returned for whitening. Note that the
            length of time used for the PSD will then be
            whatever remains along first part of the time
            axis of the input.
        sample_rate:
            Rate at which input data has been sampled in Hz
        fftlength:
            Length of FFTs to use when computing the PSD
        overlap:
            Amount of overlap between FFT windows when
            computing the PSD. Default value of `None`
            uses `fftlength / 2`
        average:
            Method for aggregating spectra from FFT
            windows, either `"mean"` or `"median"`
        fast:
            If `True`, use a slightly faster PSD algorithm
            that is inaccurate for the lowest two frequency
            bins. If you plan on highpassing later, this
            should be fine.
